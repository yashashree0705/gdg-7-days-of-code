## **GDG 7 Days of Code - Day 5 Challenge**

### **Problem Title**: *Sum of Positives*  

---

### **Problem Statement**  
Write a program to find the sum of all positive numbers in an array provided by the user.  

---

### **Input Format**  
- The first line contains an integer \( n \), representing the size of the array.  
- The second line contains \( A[n] \) space-separated integers, representing the elements of the array.  

---

### **Output Format**  
Print a single integer: the sum of all positive numbers in the array.  

---


### **Example**  

**Input 1**:  
```
5  
1 -3 5 7 -2
```  

**Output 1**:  
```
13
```  
### **Explanation**  
   - Positive numbers in the array: \( 1, 5, 7 \)  
   - Their sum is \( 1 + 5 + 7 = 13 \).  
**Input 2**:  
```
4  
-10 -20 30 40
```  

**Output 2**:  
```
70
```  
### **Explanation**  
   - Positive numbers in the array: \( 30, 40 \)  
   - Their sum is \( 30 + 40 = 70 \).  
---

### **Instructions**  
1. Iterate through the array and check for positive numbers.  
2. Compute their sum and print the result.  

**Happy Coding!!** ðŸš€
