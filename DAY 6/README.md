## **GDG 7 Days of Code - Day 6 Challenge**

### **Problem Title**: *Count the Vowels*

---

### **Problem Statement**  
Today on day 6 we will dive into strings and your task is to count the number of vowels in a given string. A vowel is any of the characters: `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`, and their uppercase counterparts (`A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `U`). The program should ignore all non-vowel characters, including spaces, digits, and special characters.

---

### **Input Format**  
- A single string \( S \), which may contain spaces, uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

---

### **Output Format**  
- Print a single integer representing the total number of vowels in the input string.

---


### **Test Case 1**  

**Input**:  
```
Hello GDG!
```  

**Output**:  
```
2
```

**Explanation**: The vowels in the string are `e`, `o`.

---

#### **Test Case 2**  

**Input**:  
```
Programming is Fun!
```  

**Output**:  
```
5
```

**Explanation**: The vowels are `o`, `a`, `i`, `i`, `u`.

---

### **Instructions**  
1. Read the input string.  
2. Traverse through each character of the string and check if it is a vowel (case-insensitive).  
3. Maintain a count of the vowels and print the result.  

**Happy Coding!!** ðŸš€
